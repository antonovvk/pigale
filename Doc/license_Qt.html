<h1>Qt Non-Commercial license version 1.0</h1>

Copyright (C) 2001 - Trolltech AS, Norway. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute this license document. 
<br>
This license applies to any software containing a notice placed by the copyright holder saying that it may be distributed under the terms of the Qt Non-Commercial License version 1.0. Such software is herein referred to as the Software. This license covers distribution of the Software, use of third-party application programs based on the Software, and non-commercial development of free software, which uses the Software.
<br>
Granted Rights
<p>
1. You are granted the non-exclusive rights set forth in this license provided you agree to and comply with any and all conditions in this license. Any use of the Software and/or whole or partial distribution of the Software, or of software items that link with the Software, in any form signifies acceptance of this license.
</p><p>
2. You may copy and distribute the Software in unmodified form provided that the entire package, including - but not restricted to - copyright, trademark notices and disclaimers, as released by the initial developer of the Software, is distributed.
</p><p>
3. You may use the original versions of the Software to compile, link and run application programs legally developed by you or by others. However, if an application program gives you access to functionality of the Software for development of application programs, reusable components or other software components (e.g. an application that is a scripting wrapper), usage of the application program is considered to be usage of the Software and is thus bound by this license.
</p><p>
4. You are as an individual granted a personal, non-exclusive non-transferable license, in a non-commercial setting, to develop application programs, reusable components and other software items that link with or in any other way require the Software. These items, when distributed, are subject to the following requirements:
</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li> They must be distributed for free and/or be freely downloadable.

<li> You must ensure that all recipients of machine-executable forms of these items are also able to receive and use the complete machine-readable source code to the items without any charge beyond the costs of data transfer.

<li> You must explicitly license all recipients of your items to use and re-distribute original and modified versions of the items in both machine-executable and source code forms. The recipients must be able to do so without any charges whatsoever, and they must be able to re-distribute to anyone they choose.
</ul>
<p>
Limitations of Liability
<br>
In no event shall the initial developers or copyright holders be liable for any damages whatsoever, including - but not restricted to - lost revenue or profits or other direct, indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, even if they have been advised of the possibility of such damages, except to the extent invariable law, if any, provides otherwise.
</p><p>
Warranty disclaimer
<br>
The Software and this license document are provided "AS IS" with NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF DESIGN, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE.
</p><p>
Choice of Law
<br>
This license is governed by the Laws of Norway. Disputes shall be settled by Oslo City Court.
